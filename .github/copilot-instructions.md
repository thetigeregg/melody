# Copilot Repository Instructions

Copilot MUST follow these instructions strictly.

## Commit Messages

Copilot MUST use the template defined in:

.github/commit-template.md

All commits MUST follow Conventional Commits:

type(scope): summary

Allowed types:

feat
fix
refactor
perf
docs
test
build
ci
chore
style

Rules:

- use lowercase type
- use present tense
- do not use vague messages
- use a scope when it adds clarity
- base content on the real diff

## Pull Requests

Copilot MUST use the template defined in:

.github/pull_request_template.md

PR titles MUST follow Conventional Commits.

PR descriptions should include:

- summary
- implementation details
- testing notes

Copilot MUST base the description on the actual changes only.

## Content Source Requirements

When generating commits or PR descriptions, Copilot MUST use:

- git diff
- staged changes
- modified files
- nearby code context

Copilot MUST NOT:

- hallucinate features
- invent changes that did not occur
- speculate beyond observable code

## Quality Expectations

Copilot should:

- follow the existing architecture and naming patterns
- prefer small deterministic edits
- avoid unrelated refactors
- keep tests and docs in sync when needed

Before suggesting final changes, Copilot should verify:

- lint passes
- tests pass
- build passes when applicable
